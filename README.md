# Notes_classifier
During the exams season, we have to click a lot of images of our as well our friends' notes. These notes help us a lot during the exams. But after the exams are over, these photos become useless and occupy a lot of space in out devices. 

It is a tedious and time consuming job to scan through all the pictures in our galley and select the images of the notes to delete them.

In this script, I have used a simple Convolutional Neural Network which is pre-trained on images belonging to classes : Notes and Non-Notes.

The CNN will classify the images into the above two classes. Images classified as "Notes" will be sent to a seperate folder from where they can be deleted in one go without wasting much time.


## *Important*
The project is still in progress and is not completed yet. I would be posting the Issues in the "Issues" tab.
